# Azure Function: Azure Stream Analytics to RESP (Redis)

This repository contains code for an Azure Function to proxy metric key updates from HTTP calls
to the RESP protocol (Redis).

The primary purpose of the Azure Function is to enable Redis key updates from Azure Stream Analytics jobs.

If an [Azure Stream Analytics job outputs to this Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/azure-functions-output)
outputs data to this Azure Function, there must always be a **`metricKey`** column (case insensitive)
such that the function knows which Redis key to upsert.
